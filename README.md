1. Project Setup Instructions: Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone <repository_url>
cd <project_directory>
Open the project in Android Studio:

Ensure you are using the latest version of Android Studio Giraffe or newer.
Install dependencies: Gradle will automatically download the required dependencies upon project sync.

Run the application:

Connect a physical Android device or use an emulator.
Build and run the project:
bash
Copy code
./gradlew installDebug

2. Libraries Used

First-party libraries:
Jetpack Compose: For building a modern declarative UI.

androidx.compose.ui and androidx.compose.material: To design a flexible and responsive interface.
Reason: Compose simplifies UI development with Kotlin.
Jetpack Navigation (Compose):

androidx.navigation:navigation-compose: For navigating between screens.
Reason: Streamlines app navigation in Compose-based projects.
Kotlin Coroutines & Flow:

kotlinx.coroutines and StateFlow: For managing asynchronous data streams.
Reason: Enables reactive programming and clean state management.
ViewModel:

androidx.lifecycle:lifecycle-viewmodel-compose: For lifecycle-aware state and data handling.
Reason: Centralized state management aligned with Android architecture best practices.


Third-party libraries:
Ktor:

io.ktor.client: For making HTTP API requests.
Reason: Lightweight, Kotlin-first HTTP client that integrates seamlessly with modern Android projects.
Coil:

io.coil-kt: For image loading.
Reason: Efficient and Compose-friendly image loading library, used to fetch planet icons.


3. Architecture Overview

This application follows the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) pattern:

Model:

Responsible for data operations.
SWAPI data is fetched using Ktor and encapsulated in data classes.
ViewModel:

Manages UI state using StateFlow.
Serves as the intermediary between the View and Model, ensuring separation of concerns.
Handles data retrieval and state updates for the UI.
View:

Built entirely using Jetpack Compose for a declarative and reactive UI.
Observes StateFlow from the ViewModel to render dynamic content.

4. Key Design Decisions

Modern Reactive Programming:
Used Kotlin Coroutines and Flow for seamless asynchronous operations and reactive state updates.
Reason: Kotlin Coroutines provide structured concurrency, and Flow ensures predictable, lifecycle-aware state handling.
Jetpack Compose:
Eliminated the need for XML layouts by adopting Compose for UI development.
Reason: Compose simplifies UI creation, enhances code readability, and supports dynamic UI updates through declarative programming.
Jetpack Navigation:
Integrated Compose Navigation for screen transitions.
Reason: Native Compose navigation makes navigation predictable and type-safe.


Hereâ€™s a comprehensive README.md file tailored to the project described:

Planet Explorer App
A mobile application that fetches and displays planet information from the Star Wars API (SWAPI) using modern Android development tools and libraries. Users can browse a list of planets, view details about individual planets, and enjoy an optional feature with planet icons.

5. Known Issues
Error Handling:

Limited handling for API request failures or connectivity issues.
Impact: The app may not display informative error messages in case of network issues.
Pagination:

The app currently fetches only the first page of planet data.
Impact: Does not support the full dataset from SWAPI.
